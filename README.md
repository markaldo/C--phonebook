# C# Phonebook (Console Application)

**A simple phonebook application built in C# that operates through the console.**

## Description

This project is a basic phonebook application implemented in C#. It allows users to store, retrieve, and manage contact information (names and phone numbers) directly through the console. The application demonstrates fundamental C# programming concepts such as data structures (lists), input/output operations, and basic program control flow.

## Key Features

*   **Add Contacts:** Allows users to add new contacts (name and phone number) to the phonebook.
*   **View Contacts:** Displays a list of all contacts currently stored in the phonebook.
*   **Search Contacts:** Enables users to search for a contact by name.
*   **Delete Contacts:** Allows users to remove a contact from the phonebook.
*   **Console-Based Interface:** Operates entirely through console input and output.

## Key Files

*   `Program.cs`: Contains the main entry point and the core logic of the phonebook application.

## Usage

1.  Compile the `Program.cs` file using a C# compiler (e.g., the one included with Visual Studio or .NET SDK).
2.  Run the executable from the command line.
3.  Follow the prompts to add, view, search, or delete contacts.

## Potential Improvements

*   **Data Persistence:** Implement data persistence (e.g., saving contacts to a file) so the phonebook data is not lost when the application closes.
*   **Error Handling:** Add more robust error handling to handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric phone numbers).
*   **User Interface:** Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve the user experience.
*   **Searching Options:** Allow for searching by phone number and improve the search algorithm.
